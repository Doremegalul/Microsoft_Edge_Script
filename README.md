# Microsoft Edge Script

I made this script because I got tired of manually searching 30 times in Microsoft Edge just to earn 150 points from Microsoft Rewards.

auto_search.py:
This is the main file that you run through CMD in your environment to start the script. It uses a set of coordinates (obtained using mouse_coordinates.py) and automates your mouse to click and enter 30-character sentences from the text file.

mouse_coordinates.py:
This file allows you to get and adjust the coordinates used in the main file.
